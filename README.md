# ðŸ§ª Diagnostic Test Probability Calculator

This Python program calculates the probability of having a disease based on diagnostic test results using **Bayes' Theorem**. It is designed to help medical professionals assess the reliability of positive or negative results given the test's sensitivity, specificity, and the disease prevalence.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What It Calculates

Given:
- **Prevalence** â€“ Probability that a person has the disease (P(Disease))
- **Sensitivity** â€“ Probability that the test is positive if the person has the disease (P(Test+ | Disease))
- **Specificity** â€“ Probability that the test is negative if the person doesnâ€™t have the disease (P(Test- | No Disease))

The program computes:
- **P(Disease | Test Positive)**
- **P(Disease | Test Negative)**

## ðŸ§ª Example

```

Enter disease prevalence (0â€“100%): 5
Enter test sensitivity (0â€“100%): 95
Enter test specificity (0â€“100%): 98

ðŸ“ˆ Probability of disease given a POSITIVE test result: 71.43%
ðŸ“‰ Probability of disease given a NEGATIVE test result: 0.26%

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher (no external libraries required)

### Run the script:

```bash
python diagnostic_test_calculator.py
````

---

## âœ… Test Cases

### Normal:

1. Prevalence = 5%, Sensitivity = 95%, Specificity = 98%
2. Prevalence = 20%, Sensitivity = 90%, Specificity = 85%
3. Prevalence = 1%, Sensitivity = 99%, Specificity = 99%

### Edge:

1. Prevalence = 0% â†’ Output should be 0% for all results
2. Prevalence = 100% â†’ Output should be 100% for positive, 0% for negative
3. Sensitivity or Specificity = 0% â†’ Return extreme probabilities
